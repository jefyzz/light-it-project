# Light-it Frontend Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to create a frontend application that enables users to manage patient data. The application should have the following features:
1. Retrieve a list of patient records from a this [API](https://63bedcf7f5cfc0949b634fc8.mockapi.io/users).
2. Display the patient records individually in cards within a user interface.
3. Each patient card should include a button or icon that allows users to view additional details (expand/collapse).
4. Implement a modal or a similar component to edit and add patient information.
5. Users should have the ability to edit existing patient data and add new patients to the list.  This has no persistent data.
6. Implement form validation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of patient data.
7. Optional: Provide user-friendly notifications for successful or failed data modifications.
8. Optional: Ensure that the application is interactive and responsive, with smooth animations where necessary.

## Technologies:
The solution must be implemented using the React/Vue ecosystem, leaving you the freedom to choose any design patterns, state management strategies, and libraries.

## UI:
You are the creative director here, feel free to make any decisions.
Avoid using UI libraries such as shadCN or MaterialUI, and we want to know how good you are at making components from the ground up, we are ok with primitives libraries.

## Guidelines:
1. Share the source code of the application in a Git repository (preferably on GitHub).
2. Showcase you organization skills, your own styling methods, domain of the selected tech, domain at making reusable components, usage of standard industry-accepted tooling (TypeScript, linting, formatters), etc...
3. Include detailed instructions on how to run the application locally.
4. Provide brief documentation explaining your design decisions and the libraries/tools you used.
